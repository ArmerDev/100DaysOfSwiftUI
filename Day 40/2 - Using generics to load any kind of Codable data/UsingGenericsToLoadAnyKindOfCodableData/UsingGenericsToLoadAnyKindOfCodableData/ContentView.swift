 We added a Bundle extension for loading one specific type of JSON data from our app bundle, but now we have a second type: missions.json. This contains slightly more complex JSON:

 - Every mission has an ID number, which means we can use Identifiable easily.
 - Every mission has a description, which is a free text string taken from Wikipedia.
 - Every mission has an array of crew, where each crew member has a name and role.
 - All but one missions has a launch date. Sadly, Apollo 1 never launched because a launch rehearsal cabin fire destroyed the command module and killed the crew.
 
 Letâ€™s start converting that to code. Crew roles need to be represented as their own struct, storing the name string and role string. So, create a new Swift file called Mission.swift and give it this code:
 */

struct ContentView: View {
    let astronauts: [String: Astronaut] = Bundle.main.decode("astronauts.json")
    
    let missions: [Mission] = Bundle.main.decode("missions.json")
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("\(astronauts.count)")
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
