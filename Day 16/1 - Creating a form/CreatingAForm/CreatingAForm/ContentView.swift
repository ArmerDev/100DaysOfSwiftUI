            Text("Hello World")
            Text("Hello World")
            Text("Hello World")
            Text("Hello World")
            Text("Hello World")
            Text("Hello World")

             The above Form can contain 10 Text views, but no more than that.
             
             Tip: In case you were curious why 10 rows are allowed but 11 is not, this is a limitation in SwiftUI: it was coded to understand how to add one thing to a form, how to add two things to a form, how to add three things, four things, five things, and more, all the way up to 10, but not beyond â€“ they needed to draw a line somewhere.
             
             This limit of 10 children inside a parent actually applies everywhere in SwiftUI.
            
             If you wanted to have 11 things inside the form you should put some rows inside a Group, as seen in ContentView2
